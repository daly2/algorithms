Exercise 5.33.
create a node per literal with edges to any node that it implies
set all nodes to false

void explore()
    if there is an unsatisfied implication,
        set the thing it implies true
        if they imply anything
            explore()

graph of nodes with all implications as edges, in the oppisite direction

list of all implications
graph of all nodes with implications as edges
while there is an implication that is not satisfied
    set the right hand variable to true, and update the list of implications as necessary
    the edges tell which ones may need to be updated
if all negatives are satisfied, return
else unsatisfiable

Exercise 5.34, page 155.  Feel free to consider n to be two less than a power of two.
Show that for any integer n that is a power of 2, there is an instance of the set cover problem
(Section 5.4) with the following properties:
i. There are n elements in the base set.
ii. The optimal cover uses just two sets.
iii. The greedy algorithm picks at least log n sets.
Thus the approximation ratio we derived in the chapter is tight.

i. let there be n towns
ii. The towns are in one cluster, that is made of two overlapping circles
iii. each school must cover >= half of the uncovered nodes, so there must be log n nodes

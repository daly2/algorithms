1. (n*n+1)/2
2. This is simply the average of the numbers 1-n multiplied
    by the number of terms.
3. (5^(n+1)-1)/4
4. This is why number systems of base b work, there are
    (b^(n+1)-1)/(b-1) possible combonations of n "digits"
    and after that more must be added to contain more
    information.
    Further explanation is how a number system in base b
    is translated to decimal with the formula 
    an*b^n+...+a0*b^0, with each "digit" coresponding to
    an a in the formula and the exponent for b as the index
    of the digit.

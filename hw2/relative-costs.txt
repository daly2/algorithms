It appears that the slowest part is the
loop, simply because it is repeated 500
times. However from prior experiance I
know that cout is quite slow, so tha
would be my second option.

The actual addition and assignment in the
loop take the same number of cycles, one
per loop.
The initialization doesn't actually take
place until there are values assigned, so
that part takes no time.
The only possible load from memory is with
the function call to cout, which is hidden.

Suppose you have a directed graph with four vertices called A, B, C, and D, and the edges are as follows:  the out-edges of A
go to B, C, and D,  the out-edges of B go to C and D, and there is just one out-edge of C, which goes to D.   Draw this graph
on a piece of paper, and verify that it is a directed acyclic graph.  Now, how many distinct paths can be used to travel
from A to D?  Hint:  the answer is between 3 and 7.)

Consider a dag with nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.  In this graph, there exist edges that connect from A to the rest of the
nodes (B through G), from B to the nodes C through G, and so forth, so that the structure is the same as in the previous
problem, except that we have more nodes.  Now, how many paths exist in this graph from A to G?)
    32, its a bitstring problem
Exercise 3.29 - pages 101,102.
    each equivilence class is a disjoint (connected)section of the overall graph
Exercise 3.30.
    well each strongly connected component is roughly equivilent to an undirected segment.

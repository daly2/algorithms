Continue reading chapter 7, from section 7.1.3
to the end of section 7.2.
Please skim section 7.6, the simplex algorithm.

Exercise 7.8.
    k=max|axi+byi-c| for i 1-7
    k>=|axi+byi-c| for i 1-7
    k>=0
Exercise 7.9.
    max(-1*(x1^2+x2^2+6)
    x1<=-1
    x2>=-1
Exercise 7.10
    13
    divided into the set containing S,C,F, and the other set, there is only a capacity of 13 from set with S to set with T

Exercise 7.17.
    a. f=11 AC,BC,DT
    b.
          A____C
        6/2\ 2/6\
        S   \/   T
        5\  / \5/
          B__3_D
        This is a graph of the capacity used, the residual graph would be all of these as back edges, and the origional edges minus these as forward edges.
        I was not able to find a good way to display all of that in a txt though...

    c. BC, AC
    d. S-A-T
        SA=5
        AT=5
    e.
    In the residual graph, any back edge that does not have a coresponding forward edge is a potential bottleneck

Exercise 7.18.
    a. Pick one source as the main one, and put edges with infinite capacity to all the other sources
        Do the same for the sinks, pick one, and give all the others infinite capacity to it
    b. Seperate the in and out edges of each vertex to two seperate verticies, with an edge of the given capacity connecting them
    c. just add the constraint that edge i must carry x
    d. in u, multiply the flow by epsilon_u, before sending it to the out edges.

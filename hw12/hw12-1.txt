Exercise 2.11, page 73.
    Well assume the base case, X,Y are 2X2 matricies, then this is the definition
    of matrix multiplication. 
    Induct on X, Y, and this is recursivly true for arbitrarily large matricies.
Exercise 2.15.
    use a for loop to put the value to the left of all the values greater than it
    use another loop to put the value to the right of all values less than it
    use pointers to split the array into 3 and return those
Exercise 2.18, page 74.
    if it uses comparison, it must be a tree, the tree will only have one leaf(The answer)
    The deth of the tree will be log(n), because you must be splitting the array.

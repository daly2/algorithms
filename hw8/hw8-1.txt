1.
    fastest for small n: 10n^2+50n+4
2.
    fastest for larg n: 500n+500
3.
    The runtime of 500n+500 is preferable, because although the cost with small n
    is greater than the other two options, its not as significant. The main cost
    is when n is large.
4.
    The runtimes should be nearly language independent, some constants and coefficients
    might change some, but the overall runtime should not, as long as you do the same things.

Arguments: a pointer to the first element of an array, an integer number of
elements in the array

Return: a pointer to the first element of the sorted array

State change: pick a random integer x such that 0<=x<size of array
            find how many numbers are larger than original array[x],
            copy x to the correct index of a new array, then copy the
            rest of the array to their positions in relation to x, while
            otherwise maintaining order
            ie, if an element is smaller than x it goes before x, and maintains
            its index if possible
            repeat until sorted
        Note: extremely inefficient, uses way more memory than is practical,
            and is not gaurenteed to be complete

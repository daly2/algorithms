Because I was in hardware last semester, I used my worksheets
from class, internet research, and a little bit of the book 
provided to refresh my memory of assembly.
Internet research was necessary because hardware is taught with
arm assembly, and the book provided appears to also be for arm.

I compiled on my own machine, which is x86-64, same as the lab
machines, however I am not sure if the operating system difference
of ubuntu will be an issue.

Let us assume that f(n) is O(g(n)), and also that g(n) is O(f(n)).  Under these assumptions, is f(n) 
necessarily Theta(g(n))?  Please write a proof or find a specific counter-example.

Well theta(g(n)) is defined as being Omega(g(n)) and O(g(n)).
We are given that f(n) is O(g(n)).
We are also told that g(n) is O(f(n)), ie g(n)<=c*(f(n)) which if we move the c
to the other side is c*(g(n))>=f(n) which is the definition of Omega, 
therefore f(n) is Omega(g(n)).

Since f(n) is O(g(n)) and f(n) is Omega(g(n)), f(n) is necessarily Theta(g(n)).


Exercise 3.6, page 96.
    Assuming no loops (nodes connected to themselves).
    The sum of the connections to each node is 2|E| because each e in E has 2 ends.
Exercise 3.26, page 100.
    a.  Well for a node to be reachable there must be a way in and a way out, as you must start and
        end at the same place.
    b.  Graphs where all nodes have even degree except the ends.
    c.  Graphs where the indegree and outdegree match on all nodes except the ends, where they may be off by one.
Exercise 3.27.
    well there must be an even number of nodes of odd degree because edges to nowhere are not a thing.
    a node has odd degree then there is gaurenteed to be a disjoint path out of it because any other
    path through it must enter and exit.

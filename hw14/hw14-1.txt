Let us assume that f(n) is O(g(n)), and also that g(n) is O(f(n)).  Under these assumptions, is f(n) 
necessarily Theta(g(n))?  Please write a proof or find a specific counter-example.

Well theta(g(n)) is defined as being Omega(g(n)) and O(g(n)).
We are given that f(n) is O(g(n)).
We are also told that g(n) is O(f(n)), ie g(n)<=c*(f(n)) which if we move the c
to the other side is c*(g(n))>=f(n) which is the definition of Omega, 
therefore f(n) is Omega(g(n)).

Since f(n) is O(g(n)) and f(n) is Omega(g(n)), f(n) is necessarily Theta(g(n)).
